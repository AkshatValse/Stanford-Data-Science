# Data-Science
Here are my Stanford data science projects that showcase my skills in the field.
There are R markdown files and pdfs in this repo.
PDFs are the best way to view my projects
Rmd files are the best way to look at my code.

These show foundational knowledge in statistics and an application of R skills.
